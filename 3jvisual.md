Regulation 3j

規則3j

“Puzzles must be clean, and must not have any markings, elevated pieces, damage, or other differences that significantly distinguish any piece from a similar piece (…)”

Regulation 3j1

規則3j1

“Puzzles are permitted to have reasonable wear, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.”

# Page 4
“Reasonable Wear”

「」

Wear should be considered reasonable if it is a result of normal use of the puzzle and if it does not give significant additional information about the state of the puzzle (e.g. about the location of specific pieces).

Considerations

• Different delegates across the world have different views of “reasonable wear” as mentioned in Regulation 3j1. For this reason, it may happen that the same puzzle is accepted by some delegates and rejected by others.

•

•This Visual Guide contains examples of puzzles with different degrees of similar issues.

合格

This puzzle’s corner is slightly damaged, and it does not make a big difference for Speed Solving events, since the crack is almost invisible.

Example 1b

Illegal

This puzzle has two big cracks that do not fall under “reasonable wear”.

For example, looking at the crack in the white piece is enough to know that it is the blue-red-white corner.
